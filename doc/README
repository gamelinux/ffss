# - A Framework For Sid Sharing
#

A bit of background on why I made this.

First off, I have no expectations that you or others will take
this policy for writing rules into use. I have personally made
this to make it easier for me to write rules, keep track of 
documentation, and make it easier for my self to share rules.

Some times when someone shares a IDS signature with you, they
might lack enough context for you to figure out by your self
what the rule is actually trying to catch. Maybe they told
you, but you forgot? Anyways, the next time you get a rule
from the same person, or from someone else, the rule is written
totally different, as the "rule writing style" changes, and
can be harder for you to read and understand.... or even
lack some fields that should be there?

I have for some time used the metadata field to push tags
into rules that I have experienced over time can be handy
when making and sharing rules.

I hope you find that this is a good thing to have in the
rule writing community, and if you try it out, give feedback
to if it worked for you or not, and why not :)

This "policy" will evolve over time if needed.
